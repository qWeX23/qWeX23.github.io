          Hi, Im Ben. As you can probably tell, I am a software engineer. It is one of my favorite things to do. 
          To top it all off, I am not even that terrible at it! My passion lies in data, however or whenever it is. 
          I thrive on being able to provide useful insights to the business. I work well with relational database systems and the code surrounding them. 
          <em>(Love JSON, hate JavaScript)</em> I try to optimize everything from the data to code to the surronding processes.
          I love to find new ways to help my team succeed.  
        </p>
